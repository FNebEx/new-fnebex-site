Back in like, 2018, I think in June, I released by first beat CD in about 4 years, Amberground. Taken from from a manga that I used to read back in high school, this six track instrumental project reminded me that I can still make cool experimental music. The vibe that I go for now is something along the lines of dusty, sampled, and loopy. Think Griselda or Shaap Records. Every now and then, I like to experiment. I like to add some nice keys to a sample. Maybe even a laser sound. And for the added bonus, some kids record.

This won't be the last time I'll make some experimental tracks. I like it. They help me grow as a music maker.
