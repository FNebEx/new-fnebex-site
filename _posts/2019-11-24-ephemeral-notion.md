First off, I'm calling this site _Ephemeral Notion_.

Secondly, I tried my hand at making a logo for the site. It's suppose to be a Mayfly. Mayflies live for like, a day. They spend most of their entire lives as larvae. The life of a bug must be weird. Literally born to die. I guess there must be something magical about that. What do I know?

Here is the logo that I made.

I plan on making some more in the future. I might have to make one for my friends dad. Let's see how that goes.
