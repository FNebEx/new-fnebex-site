Hello all, 

It's been a minute since I've done a blog post. I've been dealing with a lot over the past few months, mainly with find a job and programming. I did receive my very fist web client at the end of November! That was pretty exciting. On top of that, I finally learned how to connect a React front-end to an Express back-end. That was something that I have always wanted to do. And on top of that, I added some MongoDB functionality to the project. 

I did take a 1 month long break from producing music. I think that inadvertently happened because I fell in a funk with programming and job hunting. So looking back at it, something had to take a back seat, and it was music. But seeing as how things are looking up for me, I'll be back on the beat making grind ðŸŽ¶.

Unrelated to music or programming, after 16 years of not having it, I finally procured a copy of Pokemon Ruby. It's a game that I've wanted since 2004, but couldn't get at the time. Yet for some reason, I'm note sure why I've never asked my parents for it again. Oh well. I've turned out OK. I also picked up a copy of Mega Man Battle Network for some reason. Never really got into the MMBN series. Probably because it wasn't a platformer, but I have it now and plan on playing it. 

Lastly, this might be the very last blog post I make using this theme. It was cool to use Netlify with Jekyll and Foresty. I truly enjoyed using this stack.
