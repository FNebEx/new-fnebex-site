No lie, it fees kind of good to be typing on the site again. I was remember that day that I finally got this to work, especially the part where I was able to use the live preview function on Forestry. I did have to copy some stuff from another repo, but whatever, it works. The stack that I'm using right now, 11ty + Forestry + Netlify, seems to be doing me justice, but then again, I haven't really been active in my web development. So seeing how I focused on other things during the pandemic, I'm now making the time to practice some development.  

The biggest thing that I really need to focus on is Javascript. JS was the language that I really put a lot of time into. There's still a lot that I don't know about the language. Some stuff I just picked up from learning other languages like Python or C++ (I never want to touch that language ever again). On top of JS, I need to get back into learning React. There was once a point in my life where I really wanted to learn Vue, but it felt like there were more opportunities for React than there were Vue. Also, I just completely ignored Angular, mainly because it has the most convoluted development life. This isn't compatible with that; this is complete rewrite; this is another complete rewrite.

The one biggest problem I've always had with React is that it felt like learning a complete new language on top of learning a language. In hindsight, I should've learned JS stuff first then go to React. But I'm not giving up! I will not give up. 

I also have a goal. I want to create an app. A role playing app. Not because I care about anime and role playing, but because I believe that I can really make a more modern version of a RP app that a friend sent me. I can't remember the name of the site (nor do I really care to look it up at the moment), but that site was a blast from the past. Table layout. PHP everywhere. Injecting HTML right into the site itself. Oh, and playing music right when the page loads. 

So keeping this short, I'm back on my mission to write more JS and to do some react. And maybe some coding challenges. Peace ‚úåüèæ.
