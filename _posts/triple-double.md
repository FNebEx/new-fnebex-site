One of the biggest issues that I would find myself as an aspiring web developer is that I don't know what to make. I think that's an issue that a lot of people face. It's crazy that I've been at this since 2017 or so and I still feel like a beginner. That's probably because I'm not applying what I have already learned. So after some digging, and digging, well, really just looking at old bookmarks that I more-or-less forgot about, I came across [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges "Frontend Mentor").

Frontend Mentor is a site where the developer is present a the final product of a website or component, as either an image or Sketch file, then the developer can code the site or component. One of the coolest things about FM is that it's pretty agnostic on how the site is made. You can use a framework, library, or just old fashioned HTML/CSS/JS.

What I like about FM is that it solves my problem on what to make. Before then, I would try my best to copy the design of a that I went to a lot. I have only done this once, and it was when I made [Not Kofi](https://not-kofi.netlify.app/ "Not Kofi"). It's crazy (Krazy?) because Kofi doesn't even look like this anymore, but that's not the point. I tried my best and I think that it came out pretty well. But with Frontend Mentor, I now have good looking designs that I can go off of. So far, I have only done the [3-column preview card component challenge](). Here's a [link](https://agonizing-mint.surge.sh/ "Agonizing Mint") to the actual finished site. 

With Frontend Mentor, I am going to challenge myself to try and do a new site or component every week. I think one-a-week is completely doable. It gives me time to research and plan on how I want to make the site. And I can learn something new. On the 3-column project, I got to use media queries, something that has been bugging me for a very long time. 

Another challenge site that I liked is [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/ "Codewars"). Codewars provides a user with a prompt and it's up to them to come up with the solution. Like Frontend Mentor, it's pretty agnostic on how you solve the problem. I think it supports like, 30 languages. Last problem I solved, I made this

I'm not sure what my next project will be, but will make an effort to keep at it. This is really a positive, because I'm building the skills to turn design concepts into reality.
