I won't lie. For the past year or so, it really felt like I gave up. It just feels like I'm just not accomplishing anything. I'm not in IT or a programming position and I'm working at a bank that I got through a temp agency now making $15 an hour. (I got a raise back in the beginning of the year, so now I make $15.30 üòÅ! Keep up the good work).

I don't want to give up. There's still a part in me that want to continue doing web development. At the beginning of last year, I took a break that I didn't really want to do. Music stopped. Programming stopped. The two things that I really enjoyed stopped. But it got my head cleared. I got back into art, a passion that died around the time I started college. With drawing, it felt good to get a sketchbook and just lay it out. I was experimenting with markers (really expensive ones, too), I'm doing water color! I just got some acrylic paint in the mail a few days ago. I don't even know how to use acrylics but I'm exited.

So what does any of this have to do with programming? Or web development? Absolutely nothing. But it did get me thinking. My last web endeavor was migrating this site from Jekyll to Eleventy. Did that in like an hour or so. Then from there, I got Forestry hooked up! And the got the live preview working. That was exciting to me. 

I'm making a road map. On that map is getting back to learning React and Express. I knew I wanted to be a JS developer, and with all the libraries and frameworks out there right now, React just seemed like the most _Javascriptiest_. I wasn't trying to touch Angular because I truly believe that it is dead (no matter was Eddie is saying). And Vue just wasn't cutting it for me. Express is just a simple server. Make a endpoint for a route and hit from the front-end. 

On top of React, I got with messing with NextJS. It some time to get going because my version of Node was being screwy. So a simple uninstall/reinstall of Node fixed that problem. What's cool with Next is that it has it onw API routes, so there might now be a need for Express (still gonna learn it though). The only issue I see with using Next is that I'm low key tied to Vercel, the hosting platform that created Next. However, there seems to a way to get it to [work on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/11/30/how-to-deploy-next.js-sites-to-netlify/ "How to Deploy Next.js Sites to Netlify"), but I don't know if the API routes would work. 

This time I mean business. I'm gonna expand my knowledge on JS, learn React, and build something. In late 2019, my sister introduced me to a man who might have given me an internship if I built a React/Express/GraphQL app. I never did and I kick myself in the head for not taking it seriously everyday. Who knows, it might have lead into some serious. Probably something better than this crappy bank job. Hindsight is definitely 20/20.

Dear Kevin, you got this. Learn it. Make something with it.

Also, I need to get a portfolio going. Oh well. **La vie est dr√¥le**.
